# ionic3-pouchdb-sqlite

This repository is based upon

-   [www.techiediaries.com/ionic-sqlite-pouchdb/](https://www.techiediaries.com/ionic-sqlite-pouchdb/)

At this stage it **IS WORKING** now!

### Now for me it does work

-   on Android after doing `ionic cordova build android` and moving the resulting APK to my device
-   on Android with the **Ionic DevApp** while running `ionic serve -c`
-   on Linux in a Chrome based Browser (Vivaldi) while running `ionic serve -c`
    -   on the same machine it does NOT WORK in Firefox!

I made it public avaible to give others the chance to verify my code and may get some help. ;-)
